    A prolific author and speaker, Alan Watts was one of the first to interpret
    Eastern wisdom for a Western audience. Born outside London in 1915, he
    discovered the nearby Buddhist Lodge at a young age. After moving to the
    United States in 1938, Alan became an Episcopal priest for a time, and then
    relocated to Millbrook, New York, where he wrote his pivotal book The Wisdom
    of Insecurity: A Message for an Age of Anxiety. In 1951 he moved to San
    Francisco where he began teaching Buddhist studies, and in 1956 began his
    popular radio show, “Way Beyond the West.” By the early sixties, Alan’s
    radio talks aired nationally and the counterculture movement adopted him as
    a spiritual spokesperson. He wrote and traveled regularly until his passing
    in 1973.

      Watts was born to middle-class parents in the village of Chislehurst,
      Kent, on 6 January 1915, living at 3 (now 5) Holbrook Lane, which was
      previously lived in by author John Hemming-Clark in the early 1900s.
      Watts' father, Laurence Wilson Watts, was a representative for the London
      office of the Michelin tyre company. His mother, Emily Mary Watts, was a
      housewife whose father had been a missionary. With modest financial means,
      they chose to live in pastoral surroundings and Watts, an only child, grew
      up playing at Brookside, learning the names of wildflowers and
      butterflies. Probably because of the influence of his mother's religious
      family the Buchans, an interest in "ultimate things" seeped in. It mixed
      with Watts's own interests in storybook fables and romantic tales of the
      mysterious Far East.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watts also later wrote of a mystical dream he experienced while ill with a
      fever as a child. During this time he was influenced by Far Eastern
      landscape paintings and embroideries that had been given to his mother by
      missionaries returning from China. The few Chinese paintings Watts was
      able to see in England riveted him, and he wrote "I was aesthetically
      fascinated with a certain clarity, transparency, and spaciousness in
      Chinese and Japanese art. It seemed to float..." These works of art
      emphasised the participatory relationship of people in nature, a theme
      that stood fast throughout his life and one that he often wrote about.
      (See, for instance, the last chapter in The Way of Zen.)

      Watts left the faculty for a career in the mid-1950s. In 1953, he began
      what became a long-running weekly radio program at Pacifica Radio station
      KPFA in Berkeley. Like other volunteer programmers at the
      listener-sponsored station, Watts was not paid for his broadcasts. These
      weekly broadcasts continued until 1962, by which time he had attracted a
      "legion of regular listeners".
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1957 Watts, then 42, published one of his best known books, The Way of
      Zen, which focused on philosophical explication and history. Besides
      drawing on the lifestyle and philosophical background of Zen in India and
      China, Watts introduced ideas drawn from general semantics (directly from
      the writings of Alfred Korzybski) and also from Norbert Wiener's early
      work on cybernetics, which had recently been published. Watts offered
      analogies from cybernetic principles possibly applicable to the Zen life.
      The book sold well, eventually becoming a modern classic, and helped widen
      his lecture circuit.

      Though never affiliated for long with any one academic institution, he was
      Professor of Comparative Philosophy at the California Institute of
      Integral Studies (as mentioned above), had a fellowship at Harvard
      University (1962–1964), and was a Scholar at San Jose State University
      (1968). He also lectured to many college and university students as well
      as the general public. His lectures and books gave him far-reaching
      influence on the American intelligentsia of the 1950s–1970s, but he was
      often seen as an outsider in academia. When questioned sharply by students
      during his talk at University of California, Santa Cruz, in 1970, Watts
      responded, as he had from the early sixties, that he was not an academic
      philosopher but rather "a philosophical entertainer".

      In his writings of the 1950s, he conveyed his admiration for the
      practicality in the historical achievements of Chán (Zen) in the Far East,
      for it had fostered farmers, architects, builders, folk physicians,
      artists, and administrators among the monks who had lived in the
      monasteries of its lineages. In his mature work, he presents himself as
      "Zennist" in spirit as he wrote in his last book, Tao: The Watercourse
      Way. Child rearing, the arts, cuisine, education, law and freedom,
      architecture, sexuality, and the uses and abuses of technology were all of
      great interest to him.

      Though known for his discourses on Zen, he was also influenced by ancient
      Hindu scriptures, especially Vedanta. He spoke extensively about the
      nature of the divine reality which Man misses: how the contradiction of
      opposites is the method of life and the means of cosmic and human
      evolution, how our fundamental Ignorance is rooted in the exclusive nature
      of mind and ego, how to come in touch with the Field of Consciousness and
      Light, and other cosmic principles. These are discussed in great detail in
      dozens of hours of audio that are in part captured in the 'Out of Your
      Mind' series.

      Watts sought to resolve his feelings of alienation from the institutions
      of marriage and the values of American society, as revealed in his classic
      comments on love relationships in "Divine Madness" and on perception of
      the organism-environment in "The Philosophy of Nature". In looking at
      social issues he was quite concerned with the necessity for international
      peace, for tolerance and understanding among disparate cultures.

      In October 1973, Watts returned from a European lecture tour to his cabin
      in Druid Heights, California. Friends of Watts had been concerned about
      him for some time over his alcoholism. On 16 November 1973, at age 58, he
      died in his sleep. He was reported to have been under treatment for a
      heart condition. His body was cremated very shortly thereafter. His ashes
      were split, with half buried near his library at Druid Heights and half at
      the Green Gulch Monastery.

      A personal account of Watts' last years and approach to death is given by
      Al Chung-liang Huang in Tao: The Watercourse Way. His son Mark Watts has
      prepared a biographical documentary that details questions surrounding his
      father's death and performed ritual cremation on a nearby beach. His
      father's ashes were returned to the cabin where he had died.

      Since Watts' death, his lectures have found posthumous popularity on the
      internet, specifically YouTube.
